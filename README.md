## Don 'Ghengis_Don' Santiago

**Don-Santiago/Don-Santiago** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... homework and destiny 2 loot gremlining. Very simple human probably too simple.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... balance myself distantly close to video games while understanding the massive pain i've put myself through by mistakenly taking 18 credits. **College?** ~~Time?~~ *Video Games?* ***It is all the same.*** Regardless these things are in a way timed. I am behind in due dates. I have made a very human mistake.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... develop better study habits for sure. To me it has become painfully apparent at this time that I must play this game. Yea sounds extremely unhealthy, maybe it is, maybe it isn't it makes no difference as I took 18 credits as an equally painful double edge.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... ways to actually streamline my ideas into a focused energy outside of loot goblining.<sup> Outside of just the class project I have been toying around with making a type of combat compendium. To be honest I would be willing to be this course would provide me really good tools to develop and stylize my own gathered materials and share it with others.</sup>

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... destiny 2 raid mechanics. Yea I probably have spent way too much time on that one ultra niche activity. But for those of us who are into hunting down a creature or just plain like rhythmn mini games let me know. I'd love to pick at people who have an interest in level design and could help me develop a better understanding of a space versus a challenge.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... DSRVCC@hotmail.com

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... he/him/they/them

- âš¡ Fun fact: ... On the internet I've also been known as 'Ghengis_Don' maybe it's just the internet persona I have choosen to adopt but i do respond to it. I'll never really know why but I guess I will just conquer all of my challenges. No matter how slow the pace.
